Open Porous Media Core Library
==============================

These are release notes for opm-core.


CONTENT
-------

opm-core is the core library within OPM and contains the following 

* Eclipse deck input and preprosessing
* Fluid properties (basic PVT models and rock properties)
* Grid handling (cornerpoint grids, unstructured grid interface)
* Linear Algebra (interface to different linear solvers)
* Pressure solvers (various discretization schemes, flow models)
* Simulators (some basic examples of simulators based on sequential splitting schemes)
* Transport solvers (various discretization schemes, flow models)
* Utilities (input and output processing, unit conversion)
* Wells (basic well handling)


LICENSE
-------

The library is distributed under the GNU General Public License,
version 3 or later (GPLv3+).


PLATFORMS
---------

The opm-core module is designed to run on Linux platforms. It is also
regularly run on Mac OS X. No efforts have been made to ensure that
the code will compile and run on windows platforms.

DOWNLOADING
-----------

For a read-only download:
git clone git://github.com/OPM/opm-core.git

If you want to contribute, fork OPM/opm-core on github.


BUILDING
--------

There are two ways to build the opm-core library:

1. As a stand-alone library.
 cd opm-core
 autoreconf -i
 ./configure
 make
If you want to install the library:
 make install
or (if installing to /usr/local or similar)
 sudo make install

2. As a dune module.
 - Put the opm-core directory in the same directory
   as the other dune modules to be built (e.g. dune-commmon,
   dune-grid).
 - Run dunecontrol as normal. For more information on
   the dune build system, see
   http://www.dune-project.org/doc/installation-notes.html


DOCUMENTATION
-------------

Efforts have been made to document the code with Doxygen.
In order to build the documentation, enter the command
$ doxygen
in the topmost directory.
