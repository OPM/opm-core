Open Porous Media Core Library
==============================

These are release notes for opm-core.


CONTENT
-------

opm-core is the core library within OPM and contains the following 

* Eclipse deck input and preprosessing
* Fluid properties (basic PVT models and rock properties)
* Grid handling (cornerpoint grids, unstructured grid interface)
* Linear Algebra (interface to different linear solvers)
* Pressure solvers (various discretization schemes, flow models)
* Simulators (some basic examples of simulators based on sequential splitting schemes)
* Transport solvers (various discretization schemes, flow models)
* Utilities (input and output processing, unit conversion)
* Wells (basic well handling)


LICENSE
-------

The library is distributed under the GNU General Public License,
version 3 or later (GPLv3+).


PLATFORMS
---------

The opm-core module is designed to run on Linux platforms. It is also
regularly run on Mac OS X. No efforts have been made to ensure that
the code will compile and run on windows platforms.

# packages necessary for version control
sudo apt-get install -y git-core

# basic libraries necessary for both DUNE and OPM
sudo apt-get install -y libboost-all-dev libsuperlu3-dev libsuitesparse-dev

# for server edition of Ubuntu add-apt-repository depends on
sudo apt-get install python-software-properties

# add this repository for necessary backports (required for Ubuntu Precise)
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:opm/ppa
sudo apt-get update

# parts of DUNE needed
sudo apt-get install libdune-common-dev libdune-istl-dev libdune-grid-dev

Note: You should compile the OPM modules using the same toolchain that
      was used to build DUNE. Otherwise, you can get strange ABI errors.

DOWNLOADING
-----------

For a read-only download:
git clone git://github.com/OPM/opm-core.git

If you want to contribute, fork OPM/opm-core on github.


BUILDING
--------

There are two ways to build the opm-core library.

1. As a stand-alone library.
In this setup we recommend creating an entirely separate directory
outside the directory containing the source code and doing the build
from that separate directory (termed "the build directory").  This
configuration is sometimes referred to as an "out-of-source build".

As an example, consider the following layout in which "opm-core" refers
to the directory containing the package source code as downloaded from
GitHub

    workspace
      |
      +-- build
      |
      +-- opm-core
      |     |
      |     +-- ...
      |     |
      |     +-- opm
      |     |
      |     +-- ...

We will configure a release-type (optimised) build using traditional
Unix Makefiles within the "build" directory.  The following command
configures the build

    cd path/to/build
    cmake ../opm-core -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

If you want to debug the library you should specify the build type
"Debug" instead of "Release" in the command above. This will disable
optimizations and make it easier to step through the code.

Building the software then amounts to typing

    make

in the top-level "build" directory; i.e., the directory from which we
invoked the "cmake" utility.  On a multi-core computer system you may
want to build the software in parallel (make(1)'s "job-server" mode) in
order to reduce the total amount of time needed to complete the build.
To do so, replace the above "make" command with

    make -j N

or, possibly,

    nice -20 make -j N

in which "N" is an integer that should typically not exceed the number
of cores in the system.

Once the library has been built, it can be installed in a central,
system-wide location (often in "/usr/local") through the command

    sudo make install


2. As a dune module.
 - Put the opm-core directory in the same directory
   as the other dune modules to be built (e.g. dune-commmon,
   dune-grid). Note that for Ubuntu you can install Dune
   from the ppa as outlined above.
 - Run dunecontrol as normal. For more information on
   the dune build system, see
   http://www.dune-project.org/doc/installation-notes.html


DOCUMENTATION
-------------

Efforts have been made to document the code with Doxygen.
In order to build the documentation, enter the command

 make doc

in the topmost directory.
